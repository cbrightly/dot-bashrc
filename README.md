# dot-bashrc
My .bashrc and .bash_aliases. For eassy access, dot-bashrc corresponds (and links symbolically) to .bashrc and dot-bash_aliases is also a symbolic link to .bash_aliases. These duplicate files are here simply to make accessing and viewing them (i.e. when listing directory contents) easier
